# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project
This stock analysis dove into a group of green energy stocks picked out by Steve. Steve's parents want to invest into green energy, but Steve wants to diversify their portfolio of green stocks. We were tasked with performing an analysis on the stock data of the selected green energy stocks to see which were the highest performing.
## Results
Steve's parents were originally sold on DQ which performed really well at 199.4% in 2017 but then dropped by 62.6% in 2018. Some stocks that have gained value in both years are ENPH and RUN. Every other stock on the list had a negative in 2018 whereas only TERP had a loss in 2017. For the execution times of the original script versus the refactored script, the orignal ran at almost a full second and the refactored ran in under a quarter of a second.
## Summary
### What are the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code?
Some of the advantages of refactoring code is that it can improve the quality of code and the speed of the program. A disadvantage could be the extra time that it takes to refactor the code.
### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
Refactoring the code did take extra time, but I found that the code ran much faster with the refactored code. I think that the readability of the code was a bit tougher, but that might be better off with some extra comments.
